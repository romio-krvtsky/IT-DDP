This is an application for client-server communication with the help of Socket API. 
Initial connection and message exchange via UDP. Only one to one connection is supported.
Each client stores message history. If the same client connects after a disconnect, messages have to be recovered and displayed by reconnected client. 
To distinguish between clients, an unique identifier should be generated for each client.
